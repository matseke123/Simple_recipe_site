    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all your ingredients. </li>
        <li>
            Combine ground beef, onion, garlic, and green pepper in a large saucepan over 
            medium-high heat. Cook and stir until meat is browned and crumbly and vegetables are tender, 
            5 to 7 minutes. Drain grease. </li>
        <li>
            Stir diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste into the pan. Season with oregano, basil,
             salt, and pepper. Simmer spaghetti sauce for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve hot and enjoy! 
        </li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
        <li>
            To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles 
            lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. 
            Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking,
             either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese. 
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes. </li>
        <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving. </li>
